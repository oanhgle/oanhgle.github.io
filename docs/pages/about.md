## **About Me**

Hi there, my name is **{{ site.author.name }}** 👽<br>

I was born and raised in Viet Nam before moving to the US at 18 years old.
My interest in coding started when I took a technology class with Pascal programming language. But not until in my senior year at high school, I had a chance to participate in a STEM competition for local veterans and started to feel connected with technology. As awarded first place in the competition, I and my teammates got a trip to Washington DC and presented at #HouseOfCode in May 2019. This experience is one that I will never forget as it opened the door for my future tech vision.

I'm now a rising junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I aspire to advance more products that make people’s experience with technology memorable and change the world for the better every day. Currently, my main interest is to develop a bot that can help peers and friends with a schedule planner 

Beyond school, I love film photography 📸, cuddling my friend’s puppies 🐱🐶, and passion fruit tea with lychee jelly 🧋
